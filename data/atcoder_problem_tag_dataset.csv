Increment the number written at each edge along the path connecting vertices a_i and b_i, by one.

After Takahashi executed all of the queries, he told Aoki that, for every edge, the written number became an even number.
However, Aoki forgot to confirm that the graph Takahashi created was actually a tree, and it is possible that Takahashi made a mistake in creating a tree or executing queries.
Determine whether there exists a tree that has the property mentioned by Takahashi.

The animal numbered i (2≤i≤N-1) is adjacent to the animals numbered i-1 and i+1. Also, the animal numbered 1 is adjacent to the animals numbered 2 and N, and the animal numbered N is adjacent to the animals numbered N-1 and 1.
There are two kinds of animals in this zoo: honest sheep that only speak the truth, and lying wolves that only tell lies.
Snuke cannot tell the difference between these two species, and asked each animal the following question: ""Are your neighbors of the same species?"" The animal numbered i answered s_i. Here, if s_i is o, the animal said that the two neighboring animals are of the same species, and if s_i is x, the animal said that the two neighboring animals are of different species.

Problem StatementTakahashi is about to assemble a character figure, consisting of N parts called Part 1, Part 2, ..., Part N and N-1 connecting components. Parts are distinguishable, but connecting components are not.
Part i has d_i holes, called Hole 1, Hole 2, ..., Hole d_i, into which a connecting component can be inserted. These holes in the parts are distinguishable.
Each connecting component will be inserted into two holes in different parts, connecting these two parts. It is impossible to insert multiple connecting components into a hole.
The character figure is said to be complete when it has the following properties:

All of the N-1 components are used to connect parts.
Consider a graph with N vertices corresponding to the parts and N-1 undirected edges corresponding to the pairs of vertices connected by a connecting component. Then, this graph is connected.

Two ways A and B to make the figure complete are considered the same when the following is satisfied: for every pair of holes, A uses a connecting component to connect these holes if and only if B uses one to connect them.
Find the number of ways to make the figure complete. Since the answer can be enormous, find the count modulo 998244353.

Problem StatementFor a non-negative integer K, we define a fractal of level K as follows:

A fractal of level 0 is a grid with just one white square.

A Query Problem
We have an integer sequence of length N: a_1,\ldots,a_N. Initially, a_i = 0 (1 \leq i \leq N).
We also have a variable ans, which is initially 0.
Here, you will be given Q queries of the following forms:

For each j = l_i,\ldots,r_i, a_j := \min(a_j,v_i).

Type 3:


t_i (=3) l_i r_i


Compute a_{l_i} + \ldots + a_{r_i} and add the result to ans.

Initially, the i-th ball from the left has the integer A_i written on it.
When Snuke cast a spell, the following happens:

Let the current number of balls be k. All the balls with k written on them disappear at the same time.

Snuke's objective is to vanish all the balls by casting the spell some number of times.
This may not be possible as it is. If that is the case, he would like to modify the integers on the minimum number of balls to make his objective achievable.
By the way, the integers on these balls sometimes change by themselves.
There will be M such changes. In the j-th change, the integer on the X_j-th ball from the left will change into Y_j.
After each change, find the minimum number of modifications of integers on the balls Snuke needs to make if he wishes to achieve his objective before the next change occurs.

and M balancers that connect pairs of wires. The wires are numbered from 1 to N from top to bottom,
and the balancers are numbered from 1 to M from left to right.
Balancer i connects wires x_i and y_i (x_i < y_i).



Each balancer must be in one of two states: up or down.
Consider a token that starts moving to the right along some wire at a point to the left of all balancers.
During the process, the token passes through each balancer exactly once.
Whenever the token encounters balancer i, the following happens:

If the token is moving along wire x_i and balancer i is in the down state, the token moves down to wire y_i and continues moving to the right.
If the token is moving along wire y_i and balancer i is in the up state, the token moves up to wire x_i and continues moving to the right.
Otherwise, the token doesn't change the wire it's moving along.

Let a state of the balancing network be a string of length M, describing the states of all balancers.
The i-th character is ^ if balancer i is in the up state, and v if balancer i is in the down state.
A state of the balancing network is called uniforming if a wire w exists such that, regardless of the starting wire,
the token will always end up at wire w and run to infinity along it. Any other state is called non-uniforming.

Strings s and t are said to be isomorphic when the following conditions are satisfied:

|s| = |t| holds.
For every pair i, j, one of the following holds:
s_i = s_j and t_i = t_j.
s_i \neq s_j and t_i \neq t_j.

A string s is said to be in normal form when the following condition is satisfied:

For every string t that is isomorphic to s, s \leq t holds. Here \leq denotes lexicographic comparison.

For example, abcac is in normal form, but zyxzx is not since it is isomorphic to abcac, which is lexicographically smaller than zyxzx.

Here, we are using 24-hour notation.
That is, the local time in the i-th person's city is either d o'clock or 24-d o'clock at the moment when the local time in Takahashi's city is 0 o'clock, for example.
Then, for each pair of two people chosen from the N+1 people, he wrote out the time gap between their cities. Let the smallest time gap among them be s hours.
Find the maximum possible value of s.

Problem StatementA programming competition site AtCode provides algorithmic problems.
Each problem is allocated a score based on its difficulty.
Currently, for each integer i between 1 and D (inclusive), there are p_i problems with a score of 100i points.
These p_1 + … + p_D problems are all of the problems available on AtCode.
A user of AtCode has a value called total score.
The total score of a user is the sum of the following two elements:

Base score: the sum of the scores of all problems solved by the user.
Perfect bonuses: when a user solves all problems with a score of 100i points, he/she earns the perfect bonus of c_i points, aside from the base score (1 ≤ i ≤ D).

Takahashi, who is the new user of AtCode, has not solved any problem.
His objective is to have a total score of G or more points.
At least how many problems does he need to solve for this objective?

Takahashi will take part in an eating contest. Teams of N members will compete in this contest, and Takahashi's team consists of N players numbered 1 through N from youngest to oldest. The consumption coefficient of Member i is A_i.
In the contest, N foods numbered 1 through N will be presented, and the difficulty of Food i is F_i. The details of the contest are as follows:

A team should assign one member to each food, and should not assign the same member to multiple foods.
It will take x \times y seconds for a member to finish the food, where x is the consumption coefficient of the member and y is the difficulty of the dish.
The score of a team is the longest time it takes for an individual member to finish the food.

Before the contest, Takahashi's team decided to do some training. In one set of training, a member can reduce his/her consumption coefficient by 1, as long as it does not go below 0. However, for financial reasons, the N members can do at most K sets of training in total.

Aoki chooses an integer x.
Starting from Takahashi, the two players alternately take a card. The card should be chosen in the following manner:
Takahashi should take the card with the largest integer among the remaining card.
Aoki should take the card with the integer closest to x among the remaining card. If there are multiple such cards, he should take the card with the smallest integer among those cards.


The game ends when there is no card remaining.

Problem statement
						There is a circle which radius is 1. 
						There are $N$ vertices on the circle's circumference. 
						The vertices divides into $N$ equal parts over the circumference. 




						You can choose $3$ distinct vertices, and you can make a triangle. 
						There are $\frac{N(N - 1)(N - 2)}{6}$ ways choosing vertices.
						The question is: Calculate the area of $K$-th smallest triangle in $\frac{N(N-1)(N-2)}{6}$ triangles. 
						If the area is same, you can order in any order. 

						If $N = 4, K = 3$, the result is following:

If you select vertices $1$, $2$, and $3$, the area of triangle $= 1$.
If you select vertices $1$, $2$, and $4$, the area of triangle $= 1$.
If you select vertices $1$, $3$, and $4$, the area of triangle $= 1$.

Problem StatementSnuke has decided to play with a six-sided die. Each of its six sides shows an integer 1 through 6, and two numbers on opposite sides always add up to 7.
Snuke will first put the die on the table with an arbitrary side facing upward, then repeatedly perform the following operation:

Operation: Rotate the die 90° toward one of the following directions: left, right, front (the die will come closer) and back (the die will go farther). Then, obtain y points where y is the number written in the side facing upward.

For example, let us consider the situation where the side showing 1 faces upward, the near side shows 5 and the right side shows 4, as illustrated in the figure.
If the die is rotated toward the right as shown in the figure, the side showing 3 will face upward.
Besides, the side showing 4 will face upward if the die is rotated toward the left, the side showing 2 will face upward if the die is rotated toward the front, and the side showing 5 will face upward if the die is rotated toward the back.



Find the minimum number of operation Snuke needs to perform in order to score at least x points in total.

Problem StatementThe squirrel Chokudai has N acorns.
One day, he decides to do some trades in multiple precious metal exchanges to make more acorns.
His plan is as follows:

Get out of the nest with N acorns in his hands.
Go to Exchange A and do some trades.
Go to Exchange B and do some trades.
Go to Exchange A and do some trades.
Go back to the nest.

In Exchange X (X = A, B), he can perform the following operations any integer number of times (possibly zero) in any order:

Lose g_{X} acorns and gain 1 gram of gold.
Gain g_{X} acorns and lose 1 gram of gold.
Lose s_{X} acorns and gain 1 gram of silver.
Gain s_{X} acorns and lose 1 gram of silver.
Lose b_{X} acorns and gain 1 gram of bronze.
Gain b_{X} acorns and lose 1 gram of bronze.

Naturally, he cannot perform an operation that would leave him with a negative amount of acorns, gold, silver, or bronze.
What is the maximum number of acorns that he can bring to the nest?
Note that gold, silver, or bronze brought to the nest would be worthless because he is just a squirrel.

Problem StatementIn this problem, we consider strings consisting of (, ), [, and ].
A string x is said to be a good parentheses sequence if and only if one of the following conditions is satisfied:

x is an empty sequence.
There is a good parentheses sequence s such that concatenating (, s, and ) in this order results in x.
There is a good parentheses sequence s such that concatenating [, s, and ] in this order results in x.
There are non-empty good parentheses sequences s and t such that concatenating s and t in this order results in x.

For example, [], ([()]), and ()[()] are good parentheses sequences, but neither ()) nor ([)] is a good parentheses sequence.
Given are an even number N and integer sequences A and B of length N each.

Problem StatementOne of the buildings in Kyoto University requires a password to enter.
This password consists of lowercase alphabets and you, one of those who use the building, know the password.
The authentication system of the building calculates a hash value from the password that is entered, and checks whether the hash value matches.
The hash value of string S of length N is calculated based on the following formula.
A^1 \times C[S_1] + A^2 \times C[S_2] + ... + A^N \times C[S_N]
A is an integer more than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10, and C[a]=1, C[b]=2, ..., C[z]=26.
You are so busy that you want to pass the authentication with as short password as possible.
Find the shortest password, the hash value of which is the same as that of the original password.
If multiple passwords of the minimum length exist, find the lexicographically maximum one.

Problem StatementSnuke participated in a magic show.
A magician prepared N identical-looking boxes.
He put a treasure in one of the boxes, closed the boxes, shuffled them, and numbered them 1 through N.
Since the boxes are shuffled, now Snuke has no idea which box contains the treasure.
Snuke wins the game if he opens a box containing the treasure.
You may think that if Snuke opens all boxes at once, he can always win the game.
However, there are some tricks:

Snuke must open the boxes one by one. After he opens a box and checks the content of the box, he must close the box before opening the next box.
He is only allowed to open Box i at most a_i times.
The magician may secretly move the treasure from a closed box to another closed box, using some magic trick.
For simplicity, assume that the magician never moves the treasure while Snuke is opening some box.
However, he can move it at any other time (before Snuke opens the first box, or between he closes some box and opens the next box).
The magician can perform the magic trick at most K times.

Can Snuke always win the game, regardless of the initial position of the treasure and the movements of the magician?

Problem StatementGiven are two sequences a=\{a_0,\ldots,a_{N-1}\} and b=\{b_0,\ldots,b_{N-1}\} of N non-negative integers each.
Snuke will choose an integer k such that 0 \leq k < N and an integer x not less than 0, to make a new sequence of length N, a'=\{a_0',\ldots,a_{N-1}'\}, as follows:

a_i'= a_{i+k \mod N}\ XOR \ x

Find all pairs (k,x) such that a' will be equal to b.

What is \mbox{ XOR }?

The XOR of integers A and B, A \mbox{ XOR } B, is defined as follows:

When A \mbox{ XOR } B is written in base two, the digit in the 2^k's place (k \geq 0) is 1 if either A or B, but not both, has 1 in the 2^k's place, and 0 otherwise.

            Gorillas in Kyoto University are good at math.
            They are currently trying to solve problems to find the value of an expression that contains two functions, _ , ^.
            Each of these functions takes two input values. _ function returns the smaller of the two input values and ^ function returns the larger.
            Gorillas know that integers in the expression are non-negative and less than or equal to 99,
            but can not find out the length of the expression until they read a terminal symbol ? that represents the end of the expression. The number of characters included in each expression is less than or equal to 1000, but they do not even know this fact.
            Ai, a smart gorilla, noticed that she may be able to know the value of the expression even if they don't read the whole expression.

What is xor?

For n non-negative integers x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n, their xor, x_1~\textrm{xor}~x_2~\textrm{xor}~\ldots~\textrm{xor}~x_n is defined as follows:

 When x_1~\textrm{xor}~x_2~\textrm{xor}~\ldots~\textrm{xor}~x_n is written in base two, the digit in the 2^k's place (k \geq 0) is 1 if the number of integers among x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n whose binary representations have 1 in the 2^k's place is odd, and 0 if that count is even. 

For example, 3~\textrm{xor}~5 = 6.


They wanted to use this operation quickly, so each of them calculated the xor of the integers written on their scarfs except his scarf.
We know that the xor calculated by Snuke Cat i, that is, the xor of the integers written on the scarfs except the scarf of Snuke Cat i is a_i.

Problem StatementWe have 9K cards. For each i = 1, 2, \dots, 9, there are K cards with i written on it.
We randomly shuffled these cards and handed out five cards - four face up and one face down - to each of Takahashi and Aoki.
You are given a string S representing the cards handed out to Takahashi and a string T representing the cards handed out to Aoki.
S and T are strings of five characters each. Each of the first four characters of each string is 1, 2, \dots, or 9, representing the number written on the face-up card. The last character of each string is #, representing that the card is face down.
Let us define the score of a five-card hand as \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^9 i \times 10^{c_i}, where c_i is the number of cards with i written on them.

AtCoDeer is constructing a cube using six of these tiles, under the following conditions:

For each tile, the side with the number must face outward.
For each vertex of the cube, the three corners of the tiles that forms it must all be painted in the same color.

Help him by finding the number of the different cubes that can be constructed under the conditions.
Since each tile has a number written on it, two cubes are considered different if the set of the used tiles are different, or the tiles are used in different directions, even if the formation of the colors are the same. (Each tile can be used in one of the four directions, obtained by 90° rotations.) Two cubes are considered the same only if rotating one in the three dimensional space can obtain an exact copy of the other, including the directions of the tiles.

\(N\) chickens decided to take each other's hand (wing) and form some cycles. The way to make cycles is represented by a permutation \(p\) of \(1, \ldots , N\). Chicken \(i\) takes chicken \(p_i\)'s left hand by its right hand. Chickens may take their own hand.
Let us define the cycle containing chicken \(i\) as the set consisting of chickens \(p_i, p_{p_i}, \ldots, p_{\ddots_i} = i\). It can be proven that after each chicken takes some chicken's hand, the \(N\) chickens can be decomposed into cycles.
The beauty \(f(p)\) of a way of forming cycles is defined as the product of the size of the smallest chicken in each cycle.
Let \(b_i \ (1 \leq i \leq N)\) be the sum of \(f(p)\) among all possible permutations \(p\) for which \(i\) cycles are formed in the procedure above.
Find the greatest common divisor of \(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_N\) and print it \({\rm mod} \ 998244353\).

Problem Statement
In 2937, DISCO creates a new universe called DISCOSMOS to celebrate its 1000-th anniversary.
DISCOSMOS can be described as an H \times W grid. Let (i, j) (1 \leq i \leq H, 1 \leq j \leq W) denote the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left.
At time 0, one robot will be placed onto each square. Each robot is one of the following three types:

Type-H: Does not move at all.
Type-R: If a robot of this type is in (i, j) at time t, it will be in (i, j+1) at time t+1. If it is in (i, W) at time t, however, it will be instead in (i, 1) at time t+1. (The robots do not collide with each other.)
Type-D: If a robot of this type is in (i, j) at time t, it will be in (i+1, j) at time t+1. If it is in (H, j) at time t, however, it will be instead in (1, j) at time t+1.

There are 3^{H \times W} possible ways to place these robots. In how many of them will every square be occupied by one robot at times 0, T, 2T, 3T, 4T, and all subsequent multiples of T?

There are N balls and N+1 holes in a line. Balls are numbered 1 through N from left to right. Holes are numbered 1 through N+1 from left to right. The i-th ball is located between the i-th hole and (i+1)-th hole. We denote the distance between neighboring items (one ball and one hole) from left to right as d_i (1 \leq i \leq 2 \times N). You are given two parameters d_1 and x. d_i - d_{i-1} is equal to x for all i (2 \leq i \leq 2 \times N).
We want to push all N balls into holes one by one. When a ball rolls over a hole, the ball will drop into the hole if there is no ball in the hole yet. Otherwise, the ball will pass this hole and continue to roll. (In any scenario considered in this problem, balls will never collide.)
In each step, we will choose one of the remaining balls uniformly at random and then choose a direction (either left or right) uniformly at random and push the ball in this direction. Please calculate the expected total distance rolled by all balls during this process.
For example, when N = 3, d_1 = 1, and x = 1, the following is one possible scenario:




first step: push the ball numbered 2 to its left, it will drop into the hole numbered 2. The distance rolled is 3.
second step: push the ball numbered 1 to its right, it will pass the hole numbered 2 and drop into the hole numbered 3. The distance rolled is 9.
third step: push the ball numbered 3 to its right, it will drop into the hole numbered 4. The distance rolled is 6.

So the total distance in this scenario is 18.
Note that in all scenarios every ball will drop into some hole and there will be a hole containing no ball in the end.

More specifically, the arrangement of people is represented by four strings A, B, C and D, as follows:

For each row except the top and bottom, if the i-th character (1 \leq i \leq N) in A is 1, place a person facing right at the square (i,0); otherwise, do nothing.
For each row except the top and bottom, if the i-th character (1 \leq i \leq N) in B is 1, place a person facing left at the square (i,M+1); otherwise, do nothing.
For each column except the leftmost and rightmost, if the i-th character (1 \leq i \leq M) in C is 1, place a person facing down at the square (0,i); otherwise, do nothing.
For each column except the leftmost and rightmost, if the i-th character (1 \leq i \leq M) in D is 1, place a person facing up at the square (N+1,i); otherwise, do nothing.

Each person has a sufficient amount of non-white paint. No two people have paint of the same color.

Problem StatementThere are N white balls arranged in a row, numbered 1,2,..,N from left to right.
AtCoDeer the deer is thinking of painting some of these balls red and blue, while leaving some of them white.
You are given a string s of length K.
AtCoDeer performs the following operation for each i from 1 through K in order:

The i-th operation: Choose a contiguous segment of balls (possibly empty), and paint these balls red if the i-th character in s is r; paint them blue if the character is b.

Here, if a ball which is already painted is again painted, the color of the ball will be overwritten.
However, due to the properties of dyes, it is not possible to paint a white, unpainted ball directly in blue.
That is, when the i-th character in s is b, the chosen segment must not contain a white ball.
After all the operations, how many different sequences of colors of the balls are possible?

Problem StatementIn Republic of AtCoder, Snuke Chameleons (Family: Chamaeleonidae, Genus: Bartaberia) are very popular pets.
Ringo keeps N Snuke Chameleons in a cage.
A Snuke Chameleon that has not eaten anything is blue. It changes its color according to the following rules:

A Snuke Chameleon that is blue will change its color to red when the number of red balls it has eaten becomes strictly larger than the number of blue balls it has eaten.
A Snuke Chameleon that is red will change its color to blue when the number of blue balls it has eaten becomes strictly larger than the number of red balls it has eaten.

Initially, every Snuke Chameleon had not eaten anything. Ringo fed them by repeating the following process K times:

Grab either a red ball or a blue ball.
Throw that ball into the cage. Then, one of the chameleons eats it.

After Ringo threw in K balls, all the chameleons were red. We are interested in the possible ways Ringo could have thrown in K balls. How many such ways are there? Find the count modulo 998244353.

Problem StatementWe have two indistinguishable pieces placed on a number line.
Both pieces are initially at coordinate 0. (They can occupy the same position.)
We can do the following two kinds of operations:

Choose a piece and move it to the right (the positive direction) by 1.
Move the piece with the smaller coordinate to the position of the piece with the greater coordinate.
If two pieces already occupy the same position, nothing happens, but it still counts as doing one operation.

We want to do a total of N operations of these kinds in some order so that one of the pieces will be at coordinate A and the other at coordinate B.
Find the number of ways to move the pieces to achieve it.
The answer can be enormous, so compute the count modulo 998244353.

Problem StatementThere is a very long bench.
The bench is divided into M sections, where M is a very large integer.
Initially, the bench is vacant.
Then, M people come to the bench one by one, and perform the following action:

We call a section comfortable if the section is currently unoccupied and is not adjacent to any occupied sections.
If there is no comfortable section, the person leaves the bench.
Otherwise, the person chooses one of comfortable sections uniformly at random, and sits there.
(The choices are independent from each other).

After all M people perform actions, Snuke chooses an interval of N consecutive sections uniformly at random (from M-N+1 possible intervals), and takes a photo.
His photo can be described by a string of length N consisting of X and -: the i-th character of the string is X if the i-th section from the left in the interval is occupied, and - otherwise.
Note that the photo is directed.
For example, -X--X and X--X- are different photos.
What is the probability that the photo matches a given string s?
This probability depends on M.
You need to compute the limit of this probability when M goes infinity.
Here, we can prove that the limit can be uniquely written in the following format using three rational numbers p, q, r and e = 2.718 \ldots (the base of natural logarithm):
p + \frac{q}{e} + \frac{r}{e^2}
Your task is to compute these three rational numbers, and print them modulo 10^9 + 7, as described in Notes section.

Takahashi, who works at DISCO, is standing before an iron bar.
The bar has N-1 notches, which divide the bar into N sections. The i-th section from the left has a length of A_i millimeters.
Takahashi wanted to choose a notch and cut the bar at that point into two parts with the same length.
However, this may not be possible as is, so he will do the following operations some number of times before he does the cut:

Choose one section and expand it, increasing its length by 1 millimeter. Doing this operation once costs 1 yen (the currency of Japan).
Choose one section of length at least 2 millimeters and shrink it, decreasing its length by 1 millimeter. Doing this operation once costs 1 yen.

Find the minimum amount of money needed before cutting the bar into two parts with the same length.

Problem StatementThere are N barbecue restaurants along a street.
The restaurants are numbered 1 through N from west to east, and the distance between restaurant i and restaurant i+1 is A_i.
Joisino has M tickets, numbered 1 through M.
Every barbecue restaurant offers barbecue meals in exchange for these tickets.
Restaurant i offers a meal of deliciousness B_{i,j} in exchange for ticket j.
Each ticket can only be used once, but any number of tickets can be used at a restaurant.
Joisino wants to have M barbecue meals by starting from a restaurant of her choice, then repeatedly traveling to another barbecue restaurant and using unused tickets at the restaurant at her current location.
Her eventual happiness is calculated by the following formula: ""(The total deliciousness of the meals eaten) - (The total distance traveled)"".

Problem StatementTakahashi has a lot of peculiar devices.
These cylindrical devices receive balls from left and right.
Each device is in one of the two states A and B, and for each state, the device operates as follows:

When a device in state A receives a ball from either side (left or right), the device throws out the ball from the same side, then immediately goes into state B.
When a device in state B receives a ball from either side, the device throws out the ball from the other side, then immediately goes into state A.

The transition of the state of a device happens momentarily and always completes before it receives another ball.
Takahashi built a contraption by concatenating N of these devices. In this contraption,

A ball that was thrown out from the right side of the i-th device from the left (1 \leq i \leq N-1) immediately enters the (i+1)-th device from the left side.
A ball that was thrown out from the left side of the i-th device from the left (2 \leq i \leq N) immediately enters the (i-1)-th device from the right side.

The initial state of the i-th device from the left is represented by the i-th character in a string S.
From this situation, Takahashi performed the following K times: put a ball into the leftmost device from the left side, then wait until the ball comes out of the contraption from either end.
Here, it can be proved that the ball always comes out of the contraption after a finite time.
Find the state of each device after K balls are processed.

Some amount of water flows into the dam every morning, and any amount of water may be discharged every night, but this amount needs to be set so that no water overflows the dam the next morning.
It is known that v_i liters of water at t_i degrees Celsius will flow into the dam on the morning of the i-th day.

Here, consider each maximization separately, that is, the amount of water discharged for the maximization of the temperature on the i-th day, may be different from the amount of water discharged for the maximization of the temperature on the j-th day (j≠i).
Also, assume that the temperature of water is not affected by anything but new water that flows into the dam. That is, when V_1 liters of water at T_1 degrees Celsius and V_2 liters of water at T_2 degrees Celsius are mixed together, they will become V_1+V_2 liters of water at \frac{T_1*V_1+T_2*V_2}{V_1+V_2} degrees Celsius, and the volume and temperature of water are not affected by any other factors.

					The wind blows on the surface of the ground. The temperature of the wind changes according to the change of the altitude. The temperature of the wind at Spot 0, which is closest to the sea, is 0 degree. For each i (0 \leq i \leq N − 1), the change of the temperature of the wind from Spot i to Spot i + 1 depends only on the values of A_i and A_{i+1} in the following way:
				

If A_i \lt A_{i+1} , the temperature of the wind decreases by S degrees per altitude.

The robot arm consists of m sections and m+1 joints. The sections are numbered 1, 2, ..., m, and the joints are numbered 0, 1, ..., m. Section i connects Joint i-1 and Joint i. The length of Section i is d_i.
For each section, its mode can be specified individually. There are four modes: L, R, D and U. The mode of a section decides the direction of that section. If we consider the factory as a coordinate plane, the position of Joint i will be determined as follows (we denote its coordinates as (x_i, y_i)):
(x_0, y_0) = (0, 0).
If the mode of Section i is L, (x_{i}, y_{i}) = (x_{i-1} - d_{i}, y_{i-1}).
If the mode of Section i is R, (x_{i}, y_{i}) = (x_{i-1} + d_{i}, y_{i-1}).

Problem StatementThis is an output-only problem. You shouldn't read anything from the input.
In short, your task is to simulate multiplication by using only comparison (x < y) and addition (x + y).
There is no input in this problem, you just print a sequence of operations.
Imagine that there is a big array a[0], a[1], ..., a[N-1] of length N.
The first two values are initially two non-negative integers A and B (which are unknown to you),
    the other elements are zeros.
Your goal is to get the product A \cdot B in a[2] at the end.
You are allowed operations of two types, with the following format (where 0 \leq i, j, k < N):

+ i j k — applies operation a[k] = a[i] + a[j].
< i j k — applies operation a[k] = a[i] < a[j].
    That is, if a[i] < a[j] then a[k] becomes 1, otherwise it becomes 0.

You can use at most Q operations.
Elements of a can't exceed V.
Indices (i, j, k) don't have to be distinct.
It's allowed to modify any element of the array (including the first two).
The actual checker simulates the process for multiple pairs (A, B) within a single test.
Each time, the checker chooses values A and B, creates the array a = [A, B, 0, 0, \ldots, 0],
    applies all your operations and ensures that a[2] = A \cdot B.

Problem StatementThis is an interactive task.
AtCoDeer the deer came across N people. For convenience, the people are numbered 0 through N-1.
Among them, A are honest and the remaining B(=N-A) are unkind.
All of these N people know who are honest and who are unkind, but AtCoDeer only knows that there are A honest and B unkind people.
He is trying to identify all of the honest people by asking questions to these N people.
For one question, AtCoDeer selects a and b (0≤a,b≤N-1), and asks person a the following question: ""Is person b honest?""
An honest person will always answer correctly by ""Yes"" or ""No"".
An unkind person, however, will answer by selecting ""Yes"" or ""No"" arbitrarily.
That is, the algorithm used by an unkind person may not be simple one such as always lying or giving random fifty-fifty answers.
AtCoDeer can ask at most 2N questions. He will ask questions one by one, and the responses to the previous questions can be used when deciding the next question to ask.

Problem statement
We have an H \times W grid whose squares are painted black or white. The square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left is denoted as (i, j).
Snuke would like to play the following game on this grid. At the beginning of the game, there is a character called Kenus at square (1, 1). The player repeatedly moves Kenus up, down, left or right by one square. The game is completed when Kenus reaches square (H, W) passing only white squares.
Before Snuke starts the game, he can change the color of some of the white squares to black. However, he cannot change the color of square (1, 1) and (H, W). Also, changes of color must all be carried out before the beginning of the game.
When the game is completed, Snuke's score will be the number of times he changed the color of a square before the beginning of the game. Find the maximum possible score that Snuke can achieve, or print -1 if the game cannot be completed, that is, Kenus can never reach square (H, W) regardless of how Snuke changes the color of the squares.  
The color of the squares are given to you as characters s_{i, j}. If square (i, j) is initially painted by white, s_{i, j} is .; if square (i, j) is initially painted by black, s_{i, j} is #.

The vertices are numbered 1 through N and mutually distinguishable, and the edges are represented by (a_i,b_i) (1≦i≦M).
He is painting each edge in the graph in one of the K colors of his paint cans. As he has enough supply of paint, the same color can be used to paint more than one edge.
The graph is made of a special material, and has a strange property. He can choose a simple cycle (that is, a cycle with no repeated vertex), and perform a circular shift of the colors along the chosen cycle. More formally, let e_1, e_2, ..., e_a be the edges along a cycle in order, then he can perform the following simultaneously: paint e_2 in the current color of e_1, paint e_3 in the current color of e_2, ..., paint e_a in the current color of e_{a-1}, and paint e_1 in the current color of e_{a}.

Problem StatementN contestants participated in a competition. The total of N-1 matches were played in a knockout tournament.
For some reasons, the tournament may not be ""fair"" for all the contestants.
That is, the number of the matches that must be played in order to win the championship may be different for each contestant. The structure of the tournament is formally described at the end of this statement.
After each match, there were always one winner and one loser. The last contestant standing was declared the champion.


Figure: an example of a tournament

For convenience, the contestants were numbered 1 through N. The contestant numbered 1 was the champion, and the contestant numbered i(2 ≦ i ≦ N) was defeated in a match against the contestant numbered a_i.
We will define the depth of the tournament as the maximum number of the matches that must be played in order to win the championship over all the contestants.
Find the minimum possible depth of the tournament.
The formal description of the structure of the tournament is as follows. In the i-th match, one of the following played against each other:

Two predetermined contestants
One predetermined contestant and the winner of the j-th match, where j(j<i) was predetermined
The winner of the j-th match and the winner of the k-th match, where j and k (j,k<i, j ≠ k) were predetermined

Such structure is valid structure of the tournament, if and only if no contestant who has already been defeated in a match will never play in a match, regardless of the outcome of the matches.

Problem StatementWe will create an artwork by painting black some squares in a white square grid with 10^9 rows and N columns.
The current plan is as follows: for the i-th column from the left, we will paint the H_i bottommost squares and will not paint the other squares in that column.
Before starting to work, you can choose at most K columns (possibly zero) and change the values of H_i for these columns to any integers of your choice between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive).
Different values can be chosen for different columns.
Then, you will create the modified artwork by repeating the following operation:

Choose one or more consecutive squares in one row and paint them black. (Squares already painted black can be painted again, but squares not to be painted according to the modified plan should not be painted.)

Problem StatementWe have a tree with N vertices.
The vertices are numbered 0 through N - 1, and the i-th edge (0 ≤ i < N - 1) comnnects Vertex a_i and b_i.
For each pair of vertices u and v (0 ≤ u, v < N), we define the distance d(u, v) as the number of edges in the path u-v.
It is expected that one of the vertices will be invaded by aliens from outer space.
Snuke wants to immediately identify that vertex when the invasion happens.
To do so, he has decided to install an antenna on some vertices.
First, he decides the number of antennas, K (1 ≤ K ≤ N).
Then, he chooses K different vertices, x_0, x_1, ..., x_{K - 1}, on which he installs Antenna 0, 1, ..., K - 1, respectively.
If Vertex v is invaded by aliens, Antenna k (0 ≤ k < K) will output the distance d(x_k, v).
Based on these K outputs, Snuke will identify the vertex that is invaded.
Thus, in order to identify the invaded vertex no matter which one is invaded, the following condition must hold:

For each vertex u (0 ≤ u < N), consider the vector (d(x_0, u), ..., d(x_{K - 1}, u)). These N vectors are distinct.

2. Let x be your current coordinate, and y = x+A. The lotus at coordinate x disappears, and you move to coordinate y.
If y = N-1, the game ends.
If y \neq N-1 and there is a lotus floating at coordinate y, your score increases by s_y.
If y \neq N-1 and there is no lotus floating at coordinate y, you drown. Your score decreases by 10^{100} points, and the game ends.

Imagine a game played on a line. Initially, the player is located at position 0 with N candies in his possession, and the exit is at position E. There are also N bears in the game. The i-th bear is located at x_i. The maximum moving speed of the player is 1 while the bears do not move at all.
When the player gives a candy to a bear, it will provide a coin after T units of time. More specifically, if the i-th bear is given a candy at time t, it will put a coin at its position at time t+T. The purpose of this game is to give candies to all the bears, pick up all the coins, and go to the exit. Note that the player can only give a candy to a bear if the player is at the exact same position of the bear. Also, each bear will only produce a coin once. If the player visits the position of a coin after or at the exact same time that the coin is put down, the player can pick up the coin. Coins do not disappear until collected by the player.
Shik is an expert of this game. He can give candies to bears and pick up coins instantly. You are given the configuration of the game. Please calculate the minimum time Shik needs to collect all the coins and go to the exit.

The i-th chair from the left has the ID number a_i. Here, it is guaranteed that a_i are distinct.
Snuke has decided to mark some of the chairs and throw away the rest. Initially, no chair is marked.
We call a choice of marked chairs good when the IDs of the marked chairs are monotonically increasing from left to right.
Snuke has decided to do the following procedure to mark chairs:

We say a chair x to be nice if (and only if) the choice of marked chairs is still good when x gets marked. Let k be the current number of nice chairs.
If k=0, remove the unmarked chairs and terminate the procedure. Otherwise, choose one from the k nice chairs with equal probability, mark it, and go back to Step 1.

It can be proved that the expected value of the number of chairs that remain at the end of the procedure is a rational number. Let this value be P/Q, an irreducible fraction. Additionally, let M=10^{9}+7. Then, we can prove that there uniquely exists an integer R between 0 and M-1 (inclusive) such that P \equiv Q \times R \pmod{M}, and that value equals P \times Q^{-1} \pmod{M}, where Q^{-1} is the modular multiplicative inverse of Q. Find R.

Problem StatementConsider a circle whose perimeter is divided by N points into N arcs of equal length, and each of the arcs is painted red or blue. Such a circle is said to generate a string S from every point when the following condition is satisfied:

We will arbitrarily choose one of the N points on the perimeter and place a piece on it.
Then, we will perform the following move M times: move the piece clockwise or counter-clockwise to an adjacent point.
Here, whatever point we choose initially, it is always possible to move the piece so that the color of the i-th arc the piece goes along is S_i, by properly deciding the directions of the moves.

Assume that, if S_i is R, it represents red; if S_i is B, it represents blue.
Note that the directions of the moves can be decided separately for each choice of the initial point.
You are given a string S of length M consisting of R and B.

Problem Statement
We have an H \times W grid whose squares are painted black or white.
The square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left is denoted as cell (i, j).
Cell (i, j) is painted black if c_{i,j} = #, and cell (i, j) is painted white if c_{i,j} = ..  
Following picture is an example of grid which is H = 5, W = 5.
 
Let's think about connecting 1 \ 000 \ 000 \ 000 same H \times W grids like follows:  
 
After connecting, the grid size will be H \times \left(10^9 \times W\right). Mr.square1001 wants to move from cell (1, 1) to cell (H, 10^9 \times W). In each moves, he can move only to cell (i + 1, j) or cell (i, j + 1) from cell (i, j). In addition, he can only pass on a white cell.
Is it possible to move from the top-left corner cell to the bottom-right corner cell?  
","
Constraints

H, W is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)

Problem StatementGiven is a string S of length N consisting of (s and )s. Let S_i denote the i-th character of S.
We want to make S a balanced string (defined below) in the following procedure.
First, we do the operation below zero or more times:

Choose an integer 1 \leq i \leq N. If S_i is (, replace it with ); if S_i is ), replace it with (. The cost of this operation is C_i.

Then, we do the operation below:

Choose zero or more (possibly all) characters in S and delete them. Then, concatenate the remaining characters in S without changing the order.

Find the minimum total cost required to make S a balanced string.
A balanced string is a string that is one of the following:

An empty string;
The concatenation of A and B in this order, for some non-empty balanced strings A and B;
The concatenation of (, A, and ) in this order, for some balanced string A/

Problem StatementSnuke will run the hurdles on a number line.
He will start at coordinate 0 and finish at coordinate L.
There are N hurdles on the number line, and the i-th hurdle from the left is at coordinate x_i. (0 < x_1 < x_2 < \cdots < x_N < L holds.)
Snuke can repeatedly choose one of the three actions below and do it:

Action 1: Run the distance of 1.
Action 2: Run the distance of 0.5, jump the distance of 1, and run the distance of 0.5, for a total distance of 2.
Action 3: Run the distance of 0.5, jump the distance of 3, and run the distance of 0.5, for a total distance of 4.

Snuke goes at the speed of 1 unit distance per T_1 seconds while running, and 1 unit distance per T_2 seconds while in the air.
However, if Snuke is at coordinate x while he is not in the air and there is a hurdle at coordinate x, it takes extra T_3 seconds to go past the point. Here, T_1, T_2, and T_3 are even numbers.
Find the minimum number of seconds Snuke needs before he passes coordinate L. (If he jumps over coordinate L, we consider the time when he passes coordinate L in the air.) We can prove that the answer is an integer.

Problem StatementJoisino is about to compete in the final round of a certain programming competition.
In this contest, there are N problems, numbered 1 through N.
Joisino knows that it takes her T_i seconds to solve problem i(1≦i≦N).
In this contest, a contestant will first select some number of problems to solve.
Then, the contestant will solve the selected problems.
After that, the score of the contestant will be calculated as follows:

(The score) = (The number of the pairs of integers L and R (1≦L≦R≦N) such that for every i satisfying L≦i≦R, problem i is solved) - (The total number of seconds it takes for the contestant to solve the selected problems)

Note that a contestant is allowed to choose to solve zero problems, in which case the score will be 0.
Also, there are M kinds of drinks offered to the contestants, numbered 1 through M.
If Joisino takes drink i(1≦i≦M), her brain will be stimulated and the time it takes for her to solve problem P_i will become X_i seconds.
Here, X_i may be greater than the length of time originally required to solve problem P_i.
Taking drink i does not affect the time required to solve the other problems.
A contestant is allowed to take exactly one of the drinks before the start of the contest.

Problem StatementThere are N towns located in a line, conveniently numbered 1 through N. Takahashi the merchant is going on a travel from town 1 to town N, buying and selling apples.
Takahashi will begin the travel at town 1, with no apple in his possession. The actions that can be performed during the travel are as follows:

Move: When at town i (i < N), move to town i + 1.
Merchandise: Buy or sell an arbitrary number of apples at the current town. Here, it is assumed that one apple can always be bought and sold for A_i yen (the currency of Japan) at town i (1 ≦ i ≦ N), where A_i are distinct integers. Also, you can assume that he has an infinite supply of money.

For some reason, there is a constraint on merchandising apple during the travel: the sum of the number of apples bought and the number of apples sold during the whole travel, must be at most T. (Note that a single apple can be counted in both.)
During the travel, Takahashi will perform actions so that the profit of the travel is maximized. Here, the profit of the travel is the amount of money that is gained by selling apples, minus the amount of money that is spent on buying apples. Note that we are not interested in apples in his possession at the end of the travel.
Aoki, a business rival of Takahashi, wants to trouble Takahashi by manipulating the market price of apples. Prior to the beginning of Takahashi's travel, Aoki can change A_i into another arbitrary non-negative integer A_i' for any town i, any number of times. The cost of performing this operation is |A_i - A_i'|. After performing this operation, different towns may have equal values of A_i.

You have to perform Q queries.

In each query, you have first to perform either ADD or REMOVE operation, and then perform FIND operation.
ADD operation : You are given positive integers w, v. You put the cookie whose weight is w and whose value is v to the knapsack.

REMOVE operation : You take out the cookie with the smallest weight from the knapsack and eat it.


FIND operation : You are given non-negative integers l, r. You answer the following question:

Can you choose cookies from the knapsack so that the sum X of the weights of selected cookies satisfies l \leq (X\ {\rm mod}\ MOD) \leq r
If you can't, output -1.
Otherwise, output the maximum sum of the values of selected cookies.

Problem StatementAtCoDeer the deer and his friend TopCoDeer is playing a game.
The game consists of N turns.
In each turn, each player plays one of the two gestures, Rock and Paper, as in Rock-paper-scissors, under the following condition:
(※) After each turn, (the number of times the player has played Paper)≦(the number of times the player has played Rock).
Each player's score is calculated by (the number of turns where the player wins) - (the number of turns where the player loses), where the outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of Rock-paper-scissors.
(For those who are not familiar with Rock-paper-scissors: If one player plays Rock and the other plays Paper, the latter player will win and the former player will lose. If both players play the same gesture, the round is a tie and neither player will win nor lose.)

Problem StatementWe have a rectangular grid of squares with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns. Let (i,j) denote the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left.
On this grid, there is a piece, which is initially placed at square (s_r,s_c).
Takahashi and Aoki will play a game, where each player has a string of length N.
Takahashi's string is S, and Aoki's string is T. S and T both consist of four kinds of letters: L, R, U and D.
The game consists of N steps. The i-th step proceeds as follows:

First, Takahashi performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of S_i, or does not move the piece.
Second, Aoki performs a move. He either moves the piece in the direction of T_i, or does not move the piece.

Here, to move the piece in the direction of L, R, U and D, is to move the piece from square (r,c) to square (r,c-1), (r,c+1), (r-1,c) and (r+1,c), respectively. If the destination square does not exist, the piece is removed from the grid, and the game ends, even if less than N steps are done.
Takahashi wants to remove the piece from the grid in one of the N steps.
Aoki, on the other hand, wants to finish the N steps with the piece remaining on the grid.
Determine if the piece will remain on the grid at the end of the game when both players play optimally.

      width: 30px;
      height: auto;
   }

There are two (6-sided) dice: a red die and a blue die.
When a red die is rolled, it shows i with probability p_i percents, and when a blue die is rolled, it shows j with probability q_j percents.
Petr and tourist are playing the following game.
Both players know the probabilistic distributions of the two dice.
First, Petr chooses a die in his will (without showing it to tourist), rolls it, and tells tourist the number it shows.
Then, tourist guesses the color of the chosen die.
If he guesses the color correctly, tourist wins. Otherwise Petr wins.
If both players play optimally, what is the probability that tourist wins the game?

Problem Statement
E869120 is initially standing at the origin (0, 0) in a two-dimensional plane.
He has N engines, which can be used as follows:

When E869120 uses the i-th engine, his X- and Y-coordinate change by x_i and y_i, respectively. In other words, if E869120 uses the i-th engine from coordinates (X, Y), he will move to the coordinates (X + x_i, Y + y_i).
E869120 can use these engines in any order, but each engine can be used at most once. He may also choose not to use some of the engines.

He wants to go as far as possible from the origin.

Problem StatementThere are N holes in a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th hole are (x_i,y_i).
Let R=10^{10^{10^{10}}}. Ringo performs the following operation:

Randomly choose a point from the interior of a circle of radius R centered at the origin, and put Snuke there. Snuke will move to the hole with the smallest Euclidean distance from the point, and fall into that hole. If there are multiple such holes, the hole with the smallest index will be chosen.

For every i (1 \leq i \leq N), find the probability that Snuke falls into the i-th hole.
Here, the operation of randomly choosing a point from the interior of a circle of radius R is defined as follows:

Pick two real numbers x and y independently according to uniform distribution on [-R,R].
If x^2+y^2\leq R^2, the point (x,y) is chosen. Otherwise, repeat picking the real numbers x,y until the condition is met.
