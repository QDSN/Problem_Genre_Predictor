200/C,"Any resemblance to any real championship and sport is accidental.The Berland National team takes part in the local Football championship which now has a group stage. Let's describe the formal rules of the local championship: In the group stage the team's place is defined by the total number of scored points: the more points, the higher the place is. If two or more teams have the same number of points, then the following criteria are used (the criteria are listed in the order of falling priority, starting from the most important one): The input has five lines.The Berland team is called ""BERLAND"". It is guaranteed that the Berland team and one more team played exactly 2 games and the the other teams played exactly 3 games.Note, that the result score can be very huge, 10:0 for example.In the first sample ""BERLAND"" plays the last game with team ""CERLAND"". If Berland wins with score 6:0, the results' table looks like that in the end: In the second sample teams ""AERLAND"" and ""DERLAND"" have already won 7 and 4 points, respectively. The Berland team wins only 3 points, which is not enough to advance to the next championship stage.","The input has five lines.The Berland team is called ""BERLAND"".

You are also given a list of variables used in the program, as well as direct procedure calls that use the described variables.
